What is Cloud?
 What is the cloud?
The cloud means storing and accessing data, apps, and services over the internet instead of your own computer.

ðŸ”¹ Example:
When you save a photo in Google Drive â€“ itâ€™s saved in the cloud.
When you watch a movie on Netflix â€“ itâ€™s streamed from the cloud.
ðŸ”¹ Real meaning:
The cloud is just powerful computers (called servers) in big data centers around the world.
You connect to them using the internet.
ðŸ”¹ What can the cloud do?
Store files
Run apps (like Gmail, Zoom)
Host websites
Backup data
Analyze big data
Provide virtual machines (servers)
ðŸ”¹ Simple comparison:
Your Computer
The Cloud
Limited space & power
Large, powerful remote servers
You manage everything
Cloud company manages for you
Data stored locally
Data stored on internet servers


Before the past 20 years, there were no cloud platforms, so whenever we needed to deploy the application, we had to buy the servers physically from different regions of the world and had to configure their network and deploy the application into those servers. After deploying, suppose we require only 1 GB of RAM for maintaining, we don't have an option to buy only 1 GB RAM servers. We have to buy 100 GB of RAM for the servers. From this the major drawback is that there is a lot of waste of RAM usage, and more cost to maintain servers physically, and it is difficult overall to maintain physical servers. So, to encounter this problem, AWS came forward and introduced its cloud services by giving only the required number of servers to the users and paying only for what they have used.

Old-time companies buy servers and deploy applications
Data center â†’ a place where all the servers are stored and all the configurations are done for the servers
  
Most companies buy servers from organisations like IBM, or they create them.

 For buying a server has 100 GB RAM,100 CPU, if you run one application using 1GB RAM and CPU that the remaining 99 GB RAM & CPU will be wasted for solving which introduces virtualisation. 


What is virtualization?
Virtualization means dividing one real server into many virtual servers.
Itâ€™s like:
You have one big house (real server),
And you split it into many small flats (virtual servers),
Each flat works independently, like a mini-house with its own people (apps, OS).
ðŸ”¹ In cloud computing:
Cloud providers use virtualization to make many virtual servers on fewer physical machines.
Each user gets their own virtual machine (VM), but in reality, it runs on shared physical hardware.
ðŸ”¹ Benefits:
Use resources better
Run multiple VMs on one machine
Save cost
Easy to move, copy, or scale
Example:
You want a server for your website. Instead of buying a full machine, cloud providers give you a virtual server using virtualization. It works just like a real one!

Public Vs Private Cloud

Private cloud is simply buying servers physically and deploying our applications without the help of any cloud providers. 
On the other hand Public cloud is the cloud where we can buy servers from the cloud providers.
 
Private Cloud (Your organization manages)
The cloud environment is used only by your company.


You or your IT team handles:


Setup
Security
Maintenance
Monitoring
Can be:
On your servers (on-premises)
Or hosted on a service like AWS, but still isolated (using VPC, etc.)


More control, more security, but higher cost and responsibility.
Example: A bank builds its private cloud for internal apps.
ðŸ”¹ Public Cloud (You use, provider manages)
Services are provided by companies like AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud.
You use the resources (like virtual servers, storage, and databases).
The cloud provider manages everything behind the scenes.


Physical servers
Network
Power and cooling
Hardware upgrades


You only manage your applications and settings.
Example: You create an EC2 instance in AWS and deploy your website.
ðŸ”¹ Simple Comparison:
Feature
Private Cloud
Public Cloud
Ownership
Your company
AWS / Google / Microsoft own it
Management
You manage everything
The provider manages hardware, etc.
Users
Only your organization
Many customers (securely separated)
Cost
High (hardware, staff)
Pay for what you use
Example
The companyâ€™s internal cloud with VMs
EC2 in AWS, Google Cloud, Azure



Why Public cloud better than private?

1. Lower cost compared to private cloud.
2. Public cloud cuts down the major headaches for its users, such as maintaining servers and checking connections, and giving network configurations, as everything will be taken by cloud providers only. 
No Infrastructure Headache (Most important reason)
You donâ€™t need to buy, build, or manage physical servers, networks, or data centers.
The cloud provider (like AWS, Google, or Microsoft) does all that for you.
No worries about:
Hardware failure
Power backup
Cooling
Server upgrades
Network setup
ðŸ”¸ This saves time, effort, and skilled manpower.
2. Cost-Effective (Money)
You pay only for what you use (like rent).
No big upfront investment in hardware.
Easily scale up or down as your needs change.
Perfect for startups, small businesses, or fast-growing companies.
How is AWS better than others?
First comer in the market
AWS, Azure, GCP â€”the 3 main cloud platforms, but apart from that, Oracle Cloud, Digital Ocean, which are cloud providers
Why AWS is popular â€”> first popular mover advantage 
First comer in the market
Pioneers of cloud
They have started the entire cloud concept
Many companies started cloud, but started with AWS
Less maintenance 
Why is AWS better than others?
1. Learn Cloud Repartiation




AWS is the first cloud provider in the industry, holding a first-mover advantage.
2. AWS has the majority of the market share and offers a broader range of services. So, many companies are preferring AWS over other cloud providers.
